\begin{abstract}
The main goal of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms, as learned in class, to solve a specific data science problem: developing models capable of predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not. Using a variety of machine learning techniques, the project aims to optimize model accuracy in classifying patients into "diseased" or "healthy" categories based on clinical data. In this report, we focus on fine-tuning the models to achieve the best performance, evaluating their effectiveness using various classification metrics and ensuring robust predictions to assist in early detection and diagnosis of heart disease.
