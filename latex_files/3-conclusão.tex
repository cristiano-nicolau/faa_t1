\section{Conclusion}
Doing this project was very relevant since we not only successfully applied the machine learning algorithms learned in class, but also self-learned new techniques using online resources. While developing our work, we encountered some challenges, particularly in selecting and implementing different models. If we were to develop this project further, we would have liked to implement additional models, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees, to see how they would perform compared to the ones we already tested. Additionally, we would have liked to try feature selection techniques to better understand how reducing the number of features might impact model performance. In the end, we are very satisfied with the work we presented, as it greatly enhanced our knowledge.
